Create a new Azure Machine Learning model for GenAiGraphics Application Steps:


## STEP-1-DEFINE-YOUR-PROBLEM-STATEMENT
The GenAiGraphics application aims to address the challenge of guiding users through complex technology setups using a combination of advanced 3D graphics rendering and AI-driven interactions. Traditional setup guides often rely on text-based instructions, which can be challenging for users to follow, especially when dealing with intricate hardware configurations. This project seeks to enhance user experience by visualizing setup processes in a dynamic, interactive manner. By integrating WebGL technology with Three.js for 3D rendering and Azure ML for AI chat functionalities, genaigraphics empowers users to interact with realistic 3D models that demonstrate step-by-step procedures. The goal is to provide intuitive visual aids that simplify the setup process, reduce user errors, and enhance overall user satisfaction.

### 2-DATA-ACQUISITION
Obtain permissions and access to the data sources. Ensure that the data you collect covers a wide range of scenarios and edge cases that users might encounter during technology setups.
### 3-DATA-TYPES
    - Text Data: For AI chat functionalities, collect example queries users might ask during a setup process.
    - Image or Video Data: If available, gather visual data that corresponds to each step of the setup process. This could include screenshots, videos, or 3D model files used in your application.
### 4-DATA-PREPERATION
1. Data Cleaning:
    - Remove any duplicate or irrelevant data.
    - Standardize formats (e.g., text normalization for chat queries).
    - Handle missing data appropriately (if applicable).
2. Data Formatting:
    - Ensure data is in a format compatible with Azure ML's requirements. This typically involves preparing structured datasets or files that can be used for training and testing.
3. Data Labeling (if applicable):
    - If your model requires labeled data (supervised learning), ensure each piece of data is correctly labeled according to the task it represents (e.g., steps in a setup process, types of queries).
4. Data Splitting:
    - Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This ensures you can train your model on one set, validate its performance on another, and finally test its accuracy on a third set of unseen data.
5. Data Representation:
    - Convert your data into a format suitable for training models. This might involve vectorization of text data, normalization of numerical data, or encoding categorical data.
6. Data Validation:
    - Validate the prepared datasets to ensure they accurately represent the problem and are ready for use in training your Azure ML model.


## 3. Model Selection: 
Choose the type of model that best suits your problem. Azure ML supports a variety of machine learning algorithms and frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn) that you can use depending on your requirements.

## 4. Feature Engineering: 
Process and transform your data to create features that your model will use for training and inference. This step is crucial as it can significantly impact the performance of your model.

## 5. Model Training: 
Train your model using Azure ML's training capabilities. This involves feeding your prepared data into the chosen model and adjusting model parameters to optimize performance.

## 6. Evaluation: 
Evaluate your model using validation data to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and performance metrics.

## 7. Deployment: 
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it as a service that your application can call to perform predictions or other tasks in real-time.










Steps to Get Started:
Azure Machine Learning Studio: Log in to Azure Portal and navigate to Azure Machine Learning Studio to create and manage your workspace.

Create a New Experiment: Define a new experiment where you can upload data, select algorithms, and train models.

Use Azure ML SDK: If you prefer coding, Azure ML SDK provides Python APIs for seamless integration into your development environment.

Monitor and Improve: Continuously monitor your model's performance and retrain it with new data as needed to improve accuracy and relevance.
