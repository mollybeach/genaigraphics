# Tests

This folder contains all the test files for the project. Tests are written using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. This README provides instructions on how to set up and run tests in this project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project root directory and install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Install Jest**

   Jest is included as a dependency in the project. You can also install Jest globally on your machine by running:

   ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest @jest/globals babel-jest
    ```
## Running Tests

To run tests, navigate to the project test directory and run:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will run all the test files in the project.

## Configuration

Jest configuration is defined in jest.config.js. If you need to modify Jest settings, you can adjust the configurations in this file.

Here’s a basic example of jest.config.js:

```js
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx)$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
};

```

## Writing Tests

Test files should be placed in the tests folder. Each test file should be named with the .test.js extension (e.g., example.test.js).

Here’s an example test file:

```js
// example.test.js

import { test, expect } from '@jest/globals';
import { sum } from '../src/utils';

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

```

### Test Functions
- test(name, fn): Defines a test. The name is a string describing what the test does, and fn is a callback function where the test logic is implemented.
- expect(value): Returns an assertion object that allows you to make assertions on the value.
- toBe(expected): A matcher that checks if the value is equal to the expected value.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running tests, try the following:

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

1. **Clear Jest Cache**

    Jest caches test results to improve performance. If you encounter issues, try clearing the Jest cache by running:
    
    ```bash
    npm run test -- --clearCache
    ```

2. **Check Configuration Files**

    Ensure there are no multiple Jest configuration files that might conflict. Jest configuration should be in either jest.config.js or package.json under the jest key, but not both.


3. Resolve Module Issues
    
    Verify that the Jest configuration in jest.config.js is correctly set up. Incorrect configurations can cause issues when running tests
